# Calculating Stock Returns

### About the App

This React app would show you how much profit or loss you've made on stocks. It would turn *GREEN if you've made more than 50% profits and would turn *RED if you've lost more than 50%. 

### How does the App work?

The user needs to enter three inputs, namely: 
1. Cost price of the stock
2. Number of units bought
3. Current price of the stock.

As soon as the user clicks on the CHECK button, he/she would know the profits/losses incurred in % and also the absolute value. To learn more, check out the ABOUT section.
